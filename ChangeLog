	* Add layer mode Color. Now all of the Gimp's layer modes are
	  supported. :-)
	* Revamp the test suite inputs once again (they did not cover all
	  combinations of colored pixels vs fully white or blacK).
	
	* Version 0.8.1
	* Add layer modes Hue, Value, Saturation and tests for same.

	* Version 0.8
	* Add tests of various error diagnostics to the test suite
	* Revamp some of the test suite inputs such that HSV space
	  layer modes can be tested with the same files.

	* Version 0.7.2
	* Do not precompute the big multiplication table by default,
	  it is quick enough to do it at run-time as needed (which
	  lets the binaries shrink significantly).

	* Respect -A option when generating indexed PNG (that is,
	  create a tRNS chunk even if it's trivial); add test of
	  -A in xcf2png to the test suite.

	* Update FSF address in GPL blurbs

	* Version 0.7.1
	* A few cosmetic changes done during debianization
	* The code now passes the testsuite on several Debian
	  architectures (powerpc, alpha, ia64, amd64, hppa,
	  sparc, mipsel, m68k). Unfortunately I lack the
	  access to test on non-Debian platforms.
